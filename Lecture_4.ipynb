    "# Lecture 4: Network visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will learn how to visualize a network, emphasizing different aspects of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "NetworkX does not have strong visualization capabilities. It primarily relies upon an old, and hacked together drawing function written to utilize matplotlib. This means that matplotlib drawing is slow, non-interactive, and has many visual bugs. For example, arrows for directed graphs are particularly unpleasant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are several options to visualize a network, also utilizing wrappers for python.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, I do not recommended that NetworkX be used as a primary tool for visualization of graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, I think it is a rare instance when visualizing a graph can provide meaningful information. While many graph visualizations are aesthetically pleasing, they do not convey information about the graph that could be more easily discovered by analyzing the graph using different metrics. Moreover, because positional layouts can be arbitrary, they may cause people to view structure when there is none. This is is epeciall true as graphs become larger than 100 nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless here are some things that illustrate the basics of graph drawing in NetworkX. We will also learn the basics of network visualization with [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/), a much more pleasant tool for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other options, like [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/), [Gephi](https://gephi.org/)... that you can explore!\n",

Therefore many times it is very difficult to arrange the nodes in 2D space in a way that we can observe specific characteristics of the network. In order to arrange the nodes automatically we have graph layout algorithms. \n",
