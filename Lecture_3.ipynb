    "\n",
    "NetworkX comes with a large number of builtin graph generators, which are functions that create graph objects according to different models or from different data sources (like the classical karate club graph). These can be especially useful for testing out new measures, metrics, and dynamics, on already well tested algorithms. In this notebook, we'll go through some of the different classes of graph generators included in NetworkX and write a few of our own. There are a lot of generators in NetworkX so before you implement your own check to see NetworkX already has it! You can find a list of all the graph generators [here](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generators.html).\n",

In this model nodes are added sequentially and a fixed number of edges between new nodes and existing nodes are added with nodes being selected with probability proportional to their degree.
