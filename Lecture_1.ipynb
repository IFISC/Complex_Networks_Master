    "For this course we will be using [Jupyter lab](https://jupyter.org/), which is a browser-based platform for developing python projects. Besides that we will also create a virtual environment, which is a collection of modules that are used for our projects and will be very useful if the modules are being updated with new versions, so that in our virtual environment the code will always work, as it will use the same versions of the modules we have used for generating the code.\n",
