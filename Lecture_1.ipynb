    "\n",
    "From the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) page of [python](https://www.python.org/) we can read its general description:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.\n",

    "### Working with jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use something called [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). This notebook will serve as a quick introduction to Python and Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to print out the words `Hello, World`, all we have to do is enter the following code, and execute it. To execute code click in the box below (called a cell) and hold the Shift key and press Enter.\n"
